    - PODMASTER takes over maintenance (with original authors "blessing")
        and makes all tokens of type XML::TokeParser::Token
        with the following methods:

            is_text
            is_comment
            is_pi which is short for is_process_instruction
            is_start_tag
            is_end_tag
            is_tag

            target
            data
            raw
            attr
            attrseq
            tag
            text

        ** WARNING: The tokens will probably change
        as per http://perlmonks.com/index.pl?node_id=264094
        which shouldn't affect how you use them.

    - more tests, more pod, added TODO
